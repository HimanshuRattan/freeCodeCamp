title: alt Attribute
---
The ```alt``` attribute is used inside the ```img``` tag. 

For example when we use an img tag, it is required to use the alt attribute with it.
If the image is located at `https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9892522?v=4&s=400` , use:


```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Img Src Attribute Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9892522?v=4&s=400" alt="free code camp logo">
  </body>
</html>
```

The above code displays:

![The freeCodeCamp Avatar](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9892522?v=4&s=400?raw=true)

But, if for some reason, the user is unable to view the image, the browser will show him/her the value provided inside the ```alt``` attribute.

Hence, the user won't miss out on anything.
The practice of using ```alt``` tag is really helpful and acknowledged by modern developers.
